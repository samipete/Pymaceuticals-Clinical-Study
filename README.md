# Pymaceuticals-Clinical-Study

This code analyzes a 45 day study of a new potential treatment for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) (a common form of skin cancer). The code begins with an analysis of the data and provides the following key outputs:

    - Summary statistics: for each drug regimen including the mean, median, variance, standard deviation, and SEM of the tumor volume.

    - Bar charts that shows the total number of timepoints for all mice tested for each drug regimen (using pandas and pyplot) 
    
    - Pie charts that shows the distribution of Male vs Female mice in the study

    - Quartiles, Outliers, and a box plot displaying the distribution for 4 drugs: 'Capomulin', 'Ramicane', 'Infubinol', 'Ceftamin', and identifying which ones showed any outliers (Infubinol)

    - A line plot showing tumor volume versus timepoint for and indivdual mouse on the drug "Capomulin"

    - A scatter plot showing average tumor volume vs. mouse weight for the "Capomulin" regimen

    - Correlation and regression model for tumor volume and mouse weight
